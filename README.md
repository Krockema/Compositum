# Test different ways to walk throug composite data structures

* simple(); 
  * Connected Objects, recursive yield Enumeration
* counter(); 
  * Compositum // Array Counter, NO Recursion! 
  * Every recursion can be replaced by Iteration [Derived from: Böhm-Jacopini theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_program_theorem) 
* linqy();  
  * Cartesian // Using Build in functions of Linq to build cartesian Product
* complex();
  * OR as well as AND Connected Composites 
  * Combining the Cartesian and the recursive walk through the composite
