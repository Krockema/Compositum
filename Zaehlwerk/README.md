* Test different ways to Walk throug composite data Structures

simple(); // Compositum // Connected Objects, recursive yield Enumeration
counter(); // Compositum // Array Counter, NO Recursion! (Every recursion can be replaced by Iteration)
linqy();  // Cartesian // Using Build in functions of Linq to build cartesian Product
complex(); // OR as well as AND Connected Composites // Combining the Cartesian and the recursive walk through the composite
